                <h3>Animation &#38; Motion Graphics</h3>
                <p>The Animation and Motion Graphics program provides students with the fundamentals of two- and threedimensional
                    (2D and 3D) animation, motion graphics, and special effects. Once necessarily hand-made, expensive
                    and rare, animation has undergone a technical transformation and is now a ubiquitous part of special effect,
                    advertising campaigns, video games, movies, and television.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Upon completion of the program requirements, the Associate of Science degree in Animation and Motion Graphics
                    is awarded. Graduates of this program can enter a growing profession or transfer to bachelor-level programs in
                    Animation at Lehman College or other media related programs at senior colleges.</p>
